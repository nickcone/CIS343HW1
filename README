 use the "git status" command to see which files git knows exist.
 To add a file to a commit, you first need to add it to the staging environment. To do this, you can use the git add <filename> command
 Once you've used the git add command to add all the files you want to the staging environment, you can then tell git to package them into a commit using the git commit command. 
 How to commit: git commit -m "Your message about the commit"
 say you are on the master branch and want to create a new branch to develop your web page. Here's what you'll do: Run git checkout -b <my branch name>. This command will automatically create a new branch and then 'check you out' on it, meaning git will move you to that branch, off of the master branch.
After running the above command, you can use the git branch command to confirm that your branch was created:
to push your changes to the remote repository, you could've used either the command: git push git@github.com:git/git.git yourbranchname or git push origin yourbranchname
In order to get the most recent changes that you or others have merged on GitHub, use the git pull origin master command (when working on master branch)
use the git log command again to see all new commits.
